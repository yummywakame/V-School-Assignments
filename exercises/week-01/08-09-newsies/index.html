            <p class="intro">This refugee-run restaurant was <a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/why-was-this-refugee-owned-falafel-house-voted-the-nicest-place-in-america/">voted to be the Nicest Place in America</a> last year – and its latest initiative to care for furloughed government workers only reenforces the title.</p>
            <p>Yassin’s Falafel House in Knoxville, Tennessee has been offering free meals to federal employees who have not been receiving paychecks since the US government shut down in December.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, local community members are pitching in to cover the costs of the free meals by making donations to the restaurant.</p>
            <p class="quote">Government employees are our brothers and sisters and they are not going be alone during the longest shutdown and we can’t be the nicest place in America if we leave them alone.</p>
