Given an array of integers and a target integer, return the indices of the FIRST two numbers which add up to the target.

Assume the same element may not be used twice.

Example
```javascript
twoSum([1,2,3], 4);
//returns [0, 2] because 1 + 3 equals 4
```

*Run:* ~$ node <a href="app.js">app.js</a>

#### Console:
```console
foo@bar:~/assignments/exercises/week-07/02-two-sum (master) $ node app.js

Test1: return the indexes of [1, 2, 3] that add up to '4'
[ 0, 2 ]

Test2: return the indexes of [1, 17, 5, 3] that add up to '20'
