Hello, my name is Alice. Help me get to know you!
What is your first name? Chet
and your last name? Baker

Thanks! Nice to meet you CHET.

I am older than your mom. What's your age? 90

Awesome. So far I know that your name is Chet Baker and you're 90 years old.

Give me a short background about you, and I'll repeat back what I remember: Baker earned much attention and crit
ical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals (Chet Baker Sings, It Could Happen t
o You). Jazz historian Dave Gelly described the promise of Baker's early career as "James Dean, Sinatra, and Bix
, rolled into one." His well-publicized drug habit also drove his notoriety and fame. Baker was in and out of ja
il frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and '80s.

So, the info you gave me is 449 characters long.

This was the last half:
"eer as "James Dean, Sinatra, and Bix, rolled into one." His well-publicized drug habit also drove his notoriety and fame. Baker was in and out of jail frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and '80s."
